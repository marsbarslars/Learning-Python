# 2: Strings

A string is one data type used in Python. It is a string of characters, which can be letters, numbers, or other special characters.
In a Python program, strings are differentiated from the rest of the code by single ('') or double ("") quotation marks.
I usually use single quotations because they're more compact, and they don't require the `Shift` button to create.
In your `hello_world.py` program, `'Hello world!'` is a string.

Strings are the most basic data type you can print because they're what is used to represent characters. In fact, any non-string value gets turned into a string during printing.
